Plugin page: [http://artifacts.griffon-framework.org/plugin/clover](http://artifacts.griffon-framework.org/plugin/clover)


Provides code coverage via [Atlassian's Clover][1]. This is a direct port of the [Grails Clover plugin][2] authored by the Clover team.

Usage
-----

Clover is a Code Coverage tool that produces beautiful reports which are highly configurable and extensible.
Clover not only reports which lines of code were executed during a test run, it also reports which tests hit which lines of code.
Clover's reports include:

 * Tag Clouds of your entire project that compare Complexity with Coverage
 * A TreeMap to visualise the most complex, uncovered areas of your project
 * Fully Cross Referenced HTML view of your source code
 * Much more: See [http://atlassian.com/clover][3]
 * Test Optimization coming soon!
